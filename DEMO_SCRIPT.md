# Kitchen CPQ - Improved Workflow Demo Script

## 🎯 Key Improvements Demonstrated

### ❌ OLD FLOW PROBLEMS:
- Redundant model selection (asked in room setup AND product selection)
- Unclear phase progression
- No save points between phases
- No cascading updates when changing earlier decisions

### ✅ NEW FLOW SOLUTIONS:
- **4 Clear Phases** with visual progression
- **Single Model Selection** (in room setup, inherited by products)
- **Save Points** at each phase
- **Cascading Updates** when stepping back
- **Room Inheritance** for products and styling
